### [Grilled Carrots with Honey Mustard Glaze – Ramshackle Pantry](https://ramshacklepantry.com/grilled-carrots-with-honey-mustard-glaze/)

## Ingredients

- 8 carrots (2 carrots per serving), peeled
- 1/4 cup dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Mix the mustard, honey, lemon juice, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Pour the mixture into a dish large enough to hold the carrots.
3. Add the peeled carrots to the dish and spoon or brush the glaze over them to coat evenly.
4. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
5. Place the carrots on the grill over indirect heat, positioning the thicker ends closer to the direct heat.
6. Brush more glaze onto the carrots occasionally as they cook.
7. Turn the carrots after about 20 minutes.
8. Continue grilling for a total of 30–40 minutes, or until the carrots are tender but still firm enough to hold their shape.

## Notes

- Smaller carrots that are equal in sized and as uniform as possible are best for this recipe
- Charcoal is great for this, as the flavors impart on the vegetable because of the amount of time it is on the grill.
- Place the larger end of the carrots closer to the direct heat.
