## First marinade

- 1 kg chicken thighs, diced
- 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
- 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder

## Method

1. Place your diced chicken in a bowl with the other ingredients, mix well and leave to marinate for 30 minutes.

## Second marinade

2. Place the chicken on skewers and grill over a hot charcoal barbecue for 3-4 minutes on each side or until you have good colour all over. Alternatively, if you don't have access to a charcoal barbecue simply place into a 220Â°c oven for 8-10 minutes or until you have good colour.

## Method

1. In a large pot over medium heat, add the ghee along with the cardamon, cumin and bay leaves and infuse for 3-4 minutes.
2. Add the onion and salt, stirring occasionally and cooking for 10 minutes or until the onion starts to brown and caramelise.
3. Add the ginger garlic paste, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, raw cashews, and kasuri methi, and stir well.
4. Add the diced tomato, green chilli and coriander stalks, a pinch of salt and 150ml water, stir well and cook for a further 20 minutes or until the tomato has broken down.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Remove the bay leaves before blending until completely smooth.
6. Return the blended mixture to the pot over low heat and add the butter, honey and cream, stirring well until the butter has melted and the cream is well combined.
