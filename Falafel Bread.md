# Falafel Flatbread

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight (don't use canned chickpeas)
- 1/2 cup onion, roughly chopped
- 1 cup parsley, roughly chopped (about a one large bunch)
- 1 cup cilantro, roughly chopped (about a one large bunch)
- 1 small green chile pepper, serrano or jalapeno pepper
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cardamom
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup chickpea flour
- 3 tablespoon water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

- The night before, soak the dried chickpeas in water. Make sure the water covers the chickpeas by 2-3 inches, as they'll triple in size.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Drain and rinse the chickpeas and add them to your food processor.
- Add the onion, parsley, cilantro, pepper, garlic, cumin, salt, cardamom, black pepper, and baking soda to the food processor and pulse several times until it the texture becomes a fine grain. Then transfer the falafel mixture to a large mixing bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.
- Take the mixture out of the fridge and add the chickpea flour, water, and olive oil. Mix everything together with your hands until well combined.
- Flatten the falafel mixture onto a parchment lined baking sheet (10.5 x 15 inch). Gently press down with your hands to flatten.
- Bake for 25 minutes.
- Let the flatbread cool for about 10 minutes. Then slice it into individual pieces.
