## Ingredients

- Button mushrooms (whole or cut in half)
- Butter
- Garlic
- Salt and pepper
- Optional additions: Soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, herbs (like parsley, dill, thyme), or steak seasoning

## Preparation and Grilling

- Prepare the mushrooms: Clean the mushrooms by wiping away any dirt with a damp cloth. If using button mushrooms, you can leave them whole or cut them in half. For even cooking, try to choose mushrooms that are close in size.
- Add flavor:
- Simple toss: Toss the mushrooms with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
- Marinade: Marinate the mushrooms with ingredients like balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic for about 30 minutes.
- Garlic butter: Prepare a garlic butter by melting butter and sauteing minced garlic. This can be used as a marinade, or, as one source suggests, drizzled on the mushrooms after grilling for optimal flavor.
- Prepare for grilling: Thread the mushrooms onto skewers for easy handling on the grill, especially for smaller varieties. Soak wooden skewers in water beforehand to prevent burning. Alternatively, if using larger mushrooms like portobellos, you can place them directly on the grill grates. Another option is to grill the mushrooms in a foil packet.
- Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (400-425°F or 450-500°F). Grill the mushrooms for 7-8 minutes total, flipping them halfway through, until tender and lightly charred. If using skewers, position them perpendicular to the grill grates to avoid them falling through. If using foil packets, grill for 12-15 minutes, turning the packet over halfway.
- Serve: Enjoy the grilled mushrooms hot. You can drizzle them with the garlic butter or add fresh herbs. They are great as a side dish or used in dishes like tacos or pasta.
- Tips:
- Wipe, don't wash, the mushrooms to prevent them from becoming waterlogged.
- Marinades are great for adding flavor, but a shorter marinating time (around 30 minutes) is recommended as mushrooms absorb liquids quickly.
- Consider grilling mushrooms in foil packets for easy cleanup.
- Grilled butter button mushrooms offer a delicious, earthy, and smoky flavor that complements various grilled meats and vegetables.
